# Change Log:

## 1.1.2

- Enhancement: Artifice Off now truly disables the toolkit. It disables the CustomEditor attribute on the artifice inspector, disabling its automatic replacement of the default editor. In addition, it will enforce the toggle option upon every domain reload. This ensures consistency when initializing or updating the package.
