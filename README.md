# Artifice Toolkit
Motto

## What is the Artifice Toolkit?
The Artifice Toolkit offers you two powerful tools.

1. Artifice Inspector: Alter the appearance of your editor's inspector with simple C# custom attributes. This is editor scripting without the editor scripting knowledge being required!

2. Artifice Validator: Attach validator attributes to your serialized properties to always make sure certain rules are being followed. Don's waste time on absent minded mistakes ever again.

## Why not write custom editors and property drawers?
