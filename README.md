# Artifice Toolkit
Normally, extending Unityâ€™s editor requires specialized knowledge of IMGUI or the UI Toolkit libraries, along with maintaining separate files for each editor extension. This makes the editor's capabilities less accessible and often a hassle to research and learn.

The ArtificeToolkit simplifies this process by providing custom attributes that can be applied directly in the source code, automatically altering the appearance of properties in the editor. The toolkit can be used in a variety of creative ways and can even be extended by creating new attributes.

To demonstrate its usage and effectiveness, see the following MonoBehaviour script's inspector. On the left is the default inspector generated by Unity, and on the right is the same script with a few additional attributes.

## Why use the ArtificeToolkit?

- Visually "lightweight" inspectors reduce cognitive load by removing unnecessary information.
- A simplified interface helps developers focus on relevant details, minimizing distractions.
- Streamlining the editor reduces mental effort, improving workflow efficiency and effectiveness.


## What is included?
The Artifice Toolkit offers two powerful tools:

1. Artifice Inspector: Alter the appearance of your editor's inspector with simple C# custom attributes. This is editor scripting without the editor scripting knowledge being required!

2. Artifice Validator: Attach validator attributes to your serialized properties to always make sure certain rules are being followed. Don's waste time on absent minded mistakes ever again.

## How to install into your Unity project?
Simply add it as a Unity Package through git repository link. Curretly this can only be done through a special link since the project is private. After open-sourcing it, it will be done through the git clone link.

<!-- CUSTOM ATTRIBUTE CATEGORIES AND LINKS -->
# Custom Attributes
By using custom attributes in your MonoBehviour scripts you can quickly alter the inspectors appearance. The following categories and attributes have been currently implemented and tested.

## Top 3 Recommended Attributes
Following are the simplest to use attributes which can have a big impact on visuals of the inspector.

- [FoldoutGroup](#foldout-group)
- [Required](#required)
- [PreviewScriptable](#previewscriptable)

## Group Attributes
Group Attributes can be used to bring together various properties in a form of a group. Such groups can also work in a nested manner as shown in the [BoxGroup](#boxgroup) example.

- [BoxGroup](#boxgroup)
- [FoldoutGroup](#foldout-group)
- [TabGroup](#tab-group)
- [HorizontalGroup](#horizontal-group)
- [VerticalGroup](#vertical-group)

Note: BoxGroup and FoldoutGroup can be further enchanced using the GroupColor enum.

## Validation Attributes
Validation Attributes are used to assert certain rules over your properties. This is achieved in the inspector visualy using an error prompt, and through the use of the [ArtificeValidator](#artifice-validator).

- [Required](#required)
- [AssetOnly](#assetonly)
- [SceneObjectOnly](#sceneobjectonly)
- [ChildGameObjectOnly](#childgameobjectonly)
- [MinValue](#minvalue)
- [MaxValue](#maxvalue)

## Essential and Easy Attributes
These attributes can and should be used frequaently. They will at a bare minimum simplify and make the inspector more readable. 

- [Title](#title)
- [EnumToggle](#enumtoggle)
- [EnableIf](#enableif)
- [PreviewScriptable](#previewscriptable)
- [PreviewSprite](#previewsprite)

## Miscellaneous
- [Space](#space)
- [Range](#range)
- [HideLabel](#hidelabel)
- [InfoBox](#infobox)
- [ConditionalInfoBox](#conditionalinfobox)
- [MeasureUnit](#measureunit)

<!-- ALL ATTRIBUTES DETAILED -->
## All Attributes


<!-- GROUP ATTRIBUTES -->
### BoxGroup
The simplest form of a Group attribute is the BoxGroup. Every serialized property of the script will be packaged inside of a group with the given title.

```c#
[SerializeField, BoxGroup("GroupA")]
private int first;

[SerializeField, BoxGroup("GroupA")]
private int second;

[SerializeField, BoxGroup("GroupA/GroupB")]
private int third;
```  
![box-group-example](https://i.imgur.com/02LxpO6.jpg)


### Foldout Group
The FoldoutGroup extends the BoxGroup by allowing the user to collapse the group if he does not care about it. This information is also persistent per serialized object.

```c#
[SerializeField, BoxGroup("GroupA")]
private int first;

[SerializeField, BoxGroup("GroupA")]
private int second;

[SerializeField, FoldoutGroup("GroupA/GroupB")]
private int third;

[SerializeField, FoldoutGroup("GroupA/GroupB/GroupC")]
private int fourth;
```
![foldout-group-example](https://i.imgur.com/AQP7ON2.jpg)

### Tab Group
The TabGroup allows you to create tabs inside of the Unity inspector. The syntax is more comlex than Box and Foldout groups but it is well worth it.

```c#
[SerializeField, TabGroup("Example", "SectionA")]
private int first;

[SerializeField, TabGroup("Example", "SectionA")]
private int second;

[SerializeField, TabGroup("Example", "SectionB")]
private int third;

[SerializeField, TabGroup("Example", "SectionB")]
private int fourth;
```
![tab-group-example](https://i.imgur.com/pSx1xmk.jpg)

### Horizontal Group
The HorizontalGroup attribute allows you to align multiple properties into a single line, instead of splitting them as it is done by default. Note, that the Horizontal and Vertical groups do not show their titles and are solely used for structuring.

```c#
[SerializeField, HorizontalGroup("horizontal1")]
private List<int> leftColumn;

[SerializeField, HorizontalGroup("horizontal1")]
private List<int> rightColumn;
```
![horizontal-group-example](https://i.imgur.com/VWq8iQU.png)

### Vertical Group
The Vertical Group is only useful inside of a horizontal group, to dictate a vertical column of properties inside of it.

```c#
[SerializeField, HorizontalGroup("horizontal1"), VerticalGroup("horizontal1/vertical")]
private List<int> leftColumn;

[SerializeField, HorizontalGroup("horizontal1"), VerticalGroup("horizontal1/vertical")]
private int leftColumnInteger;

[SerializeField, HorizontalGroup("horizontal1")]
private List<int> rightColumn;
```
![vertical-group-example](https://i.imgur.com/ESVKIgs.jpg)

<!-- VALIDATION ATTRIBUTES -->
### Required
The Required field prompts the inspector with an error indicator if the property has not been set. This is GREATLY important in Unity, where it is common to initialize fields and dependencies through [SerializedField] properties. This is makes the Required field the most important and most commonly used validation attribute.

```c#
[SerializeField, Required] 
private Transform requiredFieldExample;
```

![required-example](https://i.imgur.com/gi7w0Ga.png)

### AssetOnly
AssetOnly validates that the value of the serialized property is an asset. This is helpful when you have a field for prefabs that will be later on instantiated. It is common to drag a GameObject from the scene, instead of the assets.

```c#
[SerializeField, Required, AssetOnly] 
private Transform requiredAssetOnlyExample;
```

![assetonly-example](https://i.imgur.com/5USbcuH.png)

### SceneObjectOnly
Works exactly like the [AssetOnly](#assetonly) attribute but in-reverse. This validates that the serialized property value is of an instantiated gameobject in any loaded scene.

```c#
[SerializeField, Required, SceneObjectOnly] 
private Transform requiredSceneOnlyExample;
```

![sceneobjectonly-example](https://i.imgur.com/PrHKP3a.png)

### ChildGameObjectOnly
In Unity, it is also common to have scripts which require references from the children of the GameObject. Use the ChildGameObjectOnly attribute to assert this behaviour. 

In addition, when this attribute is used, the inspector is further enchanced allowing for optimized search of the hierarchy, previewing only the valid GameObject/Scripts based on the type of the serialized property..

```c#
[SerializeField, Required, ChildGameObjectOnly] 
private Transform requiredChildOnlyExample;
```

![sceneobjectonly-example](https://i.imgur.com/aGUDBxA.png)

<!-- EASY AND ESSENTIALS -->
### Title
The Title attribute allows you to highlight a specific part or property of your inspector. It can also be used in combination with the [HideLabel](#hidelabel) to create a new visual representation of fields as shown below.

```c#
[SerializeField, Title("Name")]
private string name;

[SerializeField, Title("Age"), HideLabel, Range(0, 100)]
private int age;

[SerializeField, Title("City"), HideLabel]
private string city;
```

IMAGE

### EnumToggle
EnumToggle converts the convential for of enum rendering to a multi-button preview. The [Flags] attribute is also supported. Note, that this is useful mostly in enums with a small number of different values.

```c#
public enum Directions
{
    Up, Down, Left, Right
}

[SerializeField, EnumToggle] 
private Directions direction;
```

![enumtoggle-example](https://i.imgur.com/4MxMSk7.png)


### EnableIf
This attributes allows you to set an equallity condition using another field in the same scope to dictate where the target property will be shown or not. This is a really usefull attribute to optionally show properties that depend upon a bool check or enum check. 

```c#
[SerializeField, FoldoutGroup("On Death", GroupColor.Red)]
private bool shouldSpawnParticlesOnDestroy;

[SerializeField, FoldoutGroup("On Death", GroupColor.Red)]
[EnableIf(nameof(shouldSpawnParticlesOnDestroy), true)]
private ParticleSystem _prefabOnDeathParticles;
```
